## Installation

You can include NeoBrutalismCSS in your project in one of the following ways:

## Download

**Install with pnpm**

```sh
$ pnpm install neobrutalismcss
```

**Install with npm**

```sh
$ npm install neobrutalismcss
```

**Install with Yarn**

```sh
$ yarn add neobrutalismcss
```

### CDN

Include the following CSS link in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<!-- Option 1: unpkg CDN (always latest version) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/neobrutalismcss@latest" />

<!-- Option 2: jsDelivr CDN (specific version, or latest from GitHub) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/matifandy8/NeoBrutalismCSS/dist/index.min.css" />
```

You can use either CDN. The unpkg link always points to the latest published npm version, while the jsDelivr link fetches the latest build from the GitHub repository (or you can specify a version/tag for more control).
